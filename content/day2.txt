Naye daur ki nayi disha,
Chunane mein der to lagati hai |
Dil se syahi, syahi se khat;
Pohochane mein der to lagati hai ||

Khairiyat rehti hai sabar karne walo ki;
Ishq ko junoon banane mein der to lagti hai ||

Mera jaaaaaaaaaanu, mera pyara jaanu, mera cute cute jaanu, sweet sweet jaanu, mera princess jaanu, mera khubsurat jaanu,
daro nahi aaj sirf itna bolke nahi rukunga :), try karunga isse jyada kuch bolneka.
Toh tumhara humeshha ka sawal, tum mujhe kyu pasand ho, aaj iska answer deneka try karte hai. Mujhe aisa lagta hai, kisiko bohot pasand karne ke liye reasons nahi lagte, love and logic always have been polar opposites. Love always comes first, then the logic hits you. Sure logically I like you because you are smart, beutiful, long nice hair, loyal etc. etc. but "non logically" I think its just the feeling, feeling of recognization. Recognization or realization that you really fit into my inner world and I might fit into yours. Being with you feels like a comfortable calming breeze, and maybe thats what I always wanted, being with someone where I dont have to pretend, I dont have to push any ideologically, I dont have to be always be super strong, I just know this is where I meant to be. I like you because you challenge me, you push me to become a better man, financially, physically and emotionally. And most of all I know you really care for me and you are loyal to me and you dont hesistate to expreess that, and thats where I really fall for my jaanu.

Shayad itne saste mein tum mujhe chodoge nahi, toh let me tell me all the things I notice about you and I like, but this maybe tomorrow.
